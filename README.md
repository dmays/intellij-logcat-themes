These files support my blog post about how to customize logcat appearance in Android Studio at https://stablekernel.com/how-to-customize-logcat-appearance-in-android-studio/

These themes are based on the Default and Darcula themes available with Android Studio and only have the colors for logcat output adjusted from the theme defaults.  You can use these examples to customize logcat to your liking.

Here are the color values I used for the themes as shown in the [walkthrough](https://stablekernel.com/how-to-customize-logcat-appearance-in-android-studio/):
* ASSERT: bb2b2f
* DEBUG: 1194d6
* ERROR: db332f
* INFO: 0c890d
* VERBOSE: a8a8a8
* WARNING: bb7000
